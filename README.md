Planning for autonomous robots coursework projects
This course dwells into implementing various path planning algorithms for the motion of autonomous robots in config space.
I got to work on some very interesting projects through this course:
+ Project0 - An introductory python programming exercise: Highly recommended to clone for those who want to be familiarized with python
+ Project 1 - Solving an 8 puzzle problem by implementing BFS algorithm (see implementation in the folder Project1/)
